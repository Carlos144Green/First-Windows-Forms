# First-Windows-Forms
My first windows forms on Visual Studio to select multiple folders with no help of any other dependicies other than the ones that come with a new project. This is because with no external help the folder selection prompt does not allow selection of multiple folders. This led me to create a 2 prompt form to aquire a range of folders to use. This is shown in the GIF provided!
